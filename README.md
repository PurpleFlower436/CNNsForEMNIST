# Deep Learning Models on EMNIST

This is a project that uses Tensorflow to create a CNN model to analyze the ByClass subset of the EMNIST dataset. The goal of this project was to
create a program that can be utilized in real-time to recognize words or numbers on a screen. We created three different models: LeNet 5, VGG 16 and AlexNet.
After comparing all three models, the model that had the highest accuracy was LeNet 5.
